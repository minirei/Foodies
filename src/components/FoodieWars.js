              To throw some spice and fun into Foodie Town, the Foodie Rulers
              have decided to introduce <strong>Foodie Wars</strong> â€” a 24 hour
              tournament that will take place once a month!

              The War Zone will be split into many boxing rings, where Foodies
              who choose to participate will randomly be paired up to fight.
              Just link your wallet to the system, and select your Foodie!
